A python script to create a full usable SFrame cycle.

FullCycleCreators.py should be linked or copied to $SFRAME_DIR/python/.
sframe_create_full_cycle.py should be linked or copied to $SFRAME_DIR/bin/.

sframe_create_full_cycle.py:
	This script is able to create a full sframe analysis cycle that can
	be compiled and run right away.
	If only the CYCLENAME is given, the produced code is essentially the
	same as that created by sframe_create_cycle.py, except that it compiles
	and runs.
	The power of this extended script is that it can read a list of variables
	either directly from a root-file, or from a textile with variable declarations.
	It can then produce code that uses these variables in the sframe cycle.
	If the name of an OUTTREE is given, code will be generated to copy all input
	variables to an output tree.
	
The following describes some typical usecases:
==============================================	
	A full analysis can be created like this:
	
	$ sframe_new_package.py TestAnalysis
	$ cd TestAnalysis
	$ sframe_create_full_cycle.py -n MyNewCycle -r ntuple.root
	
	For this to work ntuple.root should contain a TTree. The name of the TTree as 
	well as the list of variables will be read from ntuple.root. Code will be 
	generated to read all the variables in ntuple.root. The config.xml file	will 
	also be configured to read this file.
	
	If a different set of variables is desired, or no root-file can be supplied,
	the script can be called like this:
	
	$ sframe_create_full_cycle.py -n MyNewCycle -v selection.C
	
	Where selection.C might contain variable declarations like this:
	""""
	//UInt_t RunNumber;
	int el_n;
	vector<float> el_pt;
	vector<float> el_eta;/*
	vector<float> el_phi;*/
	""""
	As can be seen, c-style comments can be used. Commented out variable 
	declarations will be used in commented form. The tree-name and the root-file
	name will be set to default values in the the config.xml file. These need to
	be adjusted for running.
	

The usage of sframe_create_full_cycle.py is:
$ sframe_create_full_cycle.py -h
>>
>> sframe_create_full_cycle.py : Analysis cycle torso creator
>>

Usage: sframe_create_full_cycle.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n CYCLENAME, --name=CYCLENAME
                        Name of the analysis cycle to create
  -l LINKDEF, --linkdef=LINKDEF
                        Name of the LinkDef.h file in the package
  -r ROOTFILE, --rootfile=ROOTFILE
                        Name a rootfile to use as the input. The tree name and
                        the variable list can be read from here.
  -t TREENAME, --treename=TREENAME
                        Name of the tree in the input file
  -v VARLIST, --varlist=VARLIST
                        Name a file containing a list of variable declarations
                        to be used in the cycle. Can contain comments.
  -a ANALYSIS, --analysis=ANALYSIS
                        Name of the analysis package. Defaults to the name of
                        the pwd.
  -o OUTTREE, --outtree=OUTTREE
                        Name of the output tree, if it should be written.
