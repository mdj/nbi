NBI HEP Tier 3 storage element client tools

A suite of command lines tools for manipulating and querying the storage element.

Requirements:
* cURL 
* Python 2.3 or higher (2.7 recommended)


Place user certificate and private key in ~/.globus/
Place the files in "bin" in the search path by sourcing setup.sh


To avoid reentering the password every time, place a file called ~/.globus/t3password  (readable to you only:  chmod a-rw u+r ~/.globus/t3password) with your password.
Alternatively, remove the password from your private key file.
