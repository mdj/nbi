These functions facilitate the use of nordugrid grid proxies on a MacOS X environment.
It is assumed that you have already installed the mac-release of the nordugrid-arc-nox
which can be found at http://download.nordugrid.org/software/nordugrid-arc-nox/releases/1.2.0/

Usage:
Put the following two lines somewhere in your ~/.bash_profile file:
. $HOME/code/nbi/arc_setup_macsetup.sh
gridcheck

(If you have unpacked the repository to a different place, adjust the path accordingly)

Functions:
	gridenv:
		Set up the variables X509_CERT_DIR and X509_USER_PROXY
		which are needed on a mac in order to be able to use xrootd services, 
		such as opening root-files with paths starting with root://
		
	gridproxy:
		Make a new grid-proxy using the command "arcproxy". The maximum valididy
		period of 12 hours will be used.
		
	gridcheck:
		gridcheck will ckeck if you have a valid grid proxy. If you do, it will
		call gridenv, and tell you for how much longer your proxy will be valid. 
		If you need a longer validity period, renew your proxy with "gridproxy".
		
		If you do not have a valid proxy, and your userkey is encrypted, you will
		be reminded to make one to be able to use grid-services.
		
		If your userkey is not password protected, gridcheck will make a new proxy
		if needed.

Notes:
	If you want "gridcheck" to make a proxy automatically, you have to remove the 
	encryption from your userkey. 
	YOU SHOULD ONLY DO THIS IF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE SECURITY RISKS INVOLVED!!
	This can be done with the command:
	openssl rsa -in ~/.globus/userkey.pem -out ~/.globus/userkey.pem.new
	userkey.pem.new has to be renamed to userkey.pem for this to work.
	
	In order to add a password again (or change the existing password) use:
	openssl rsa -in ~/.globus/userkey.pem -des3 -out ~/.globus/userkey.pem.new
	again userkey.pem.new has to be renamed to userkey.pem before the change takes effect.
